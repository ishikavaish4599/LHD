BOOK SHARING FORUM USING C.THERE IS A PHYSICAL BOOK BANK AT OUR COLLEGE WHERE STUDENTS CAN DONATE AND RENT OLD/USED BOOKS INSTEAD OF BUYING NEW ONES. MY PROGRAM ACTS AS A SOFTWARE WHERE YOU CAN LOG-IN/REGISTER AND PLACE AN ORDER OF BOOKS OR DONATE BOOKS. THE PROGRAM DATABASE KEEPS ON UPDATING AFTER EVERY ACTION. THIS REDUCES THE WAITING TIME OF THE STUDENTS IN QUEUES AND LETS THEM KNOW ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE BOOK. FUTURE IDEAS: HAVE A DYNAMIC EXTERNAL DATABASE AND MAKE THIS IDEA INTO AN ANDROID APP.
